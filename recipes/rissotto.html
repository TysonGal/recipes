    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Wait, a pumpkin recipe in January? Yes, we link pumpkins rather with autumn, and the peak of pumpkin season is actually in October. However, thanks to good storage, pumpkins can still be bought until the end of winter. And somehow, there was a pumpkin in my kitchen just recently. I thought about cooking a classic pumpkin soup, but I was quite hungry and needed something more hearty. So just a bit later, I served myself a creamy pumpkin risotto with this intense, lovely color. Being so smart, I prepared the double serving, so I could eat one plate full of risotto directly, and freeze the rest for later.

        The preparation of this recipe is super simple. Parallelly, you need to cook the risotto and prepare the pumpkin puree. For this, I prefer to bake the pumpkin, but you can also transfer the pumpkin to a pot, add some water, and cook gently with a lid until the pumpkin is soft, or steam it. Depending on the type of pumpkin you have, you might need to peel it before, so it's best to check this out after you bought it. I used a Hokkaido pumpkin that does not need to be peeled, but you can also use butternut squash or musqu√©e de Provence (both have edible peels, but they need to cook for quite some time to soften).
